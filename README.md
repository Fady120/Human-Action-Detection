# Human-Action-Detection
This project is done for the college course CC511 Introduction to Artificial Intelligence, which requires us to make a classifier with the following criteria.
> * a. A summary for the classification model should be printed with the total number of parameters.
> * b. Specify all the training parameters (loss, optimizer, metrics, â€¦etc)
> * c. Use cross validation to train the model.
> * d. Performance curves must be plotted (training vs validation accuracy and loss)
> * e. Confusion matrix and test accuracy score must be printed.


the project is used with [this dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/emirhanai/human-action-detection-artificial-intelligence) from kaggle

Note: not all 15 class are used, only the following classes (drinking, eating, fighting, dancing, clapping & laughing) as per requirements.

the project is done using hand-crafted model with convolution and pooling layers, and another transfer learning model ( inception v3 )
